### Gauss-Hermite quadratures for expectation approximations

#### To generate a table of sigma point nodes and weights, run:
```
cd GaussianVI/build
./src/save_SparseGH_weights
```
and a map from degree and dimension to the nodes and weights will be saved in a binary file under GaussianVI/quadrature folder.
